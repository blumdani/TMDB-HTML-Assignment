# TMDB-HTML-Assignment

Included in this repository is the TMDB_API.html file, which will open in a native browser.

Overview:
HTML5 (with Javascript, Ajax, and a little CSS for good measure) seemed to lend itself well to this project. Javascript deals well with API calls, and HTML5 is a good, intuitive structure for the webpage front-end design. Python and Django were also considered, but ultimately not utilized. It would be an interesting experience to go back and attempt to recreate the work using Python and Django.

This methodology was appealing because the project was standalone. Whereas alternative methods considered would need libraries and other programs installed, HTML5 is ubiquitous and can easily be used in a browser with Javascript, CSS, and Ajax. I don't have access to any sort of website hosting, so the HTML file will be opened locally on the machine it is being run on.

Instructions:
-Select and open the HTML file.
-Refer to the "HOW TO" blurb. Essentially there are two different searches the user can run:
1. Movie Search: Search for list of movies by name. This will return a list of movies (up to the top 20) that contain the word or phrase  that  was entered. Each movie will list its corresponding ID number.
2. ID Search: Search for additional information about one particular movie. This will return all available information for the particular movie corresponding to the ID entered. IDs can be found using the first search method, or by inquiring via TMDB's website.
